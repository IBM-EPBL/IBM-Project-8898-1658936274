# Introduction

Nutrition is defined as the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances. Essential nutrients include protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals and electrolytes. Normally, 85% of daily energy use is from fat and carbohydrates and 15% from protein. The required amounts of the essential nutrients differ by age and the state of the body, for example: physical activity, diseases present (e.g. Bones – known as osteoporosis), medications. Nutrition is essential for growth and development, health and wellbeing, eating a healthy diet contributes to preventing future illness and improving quality and length of life.

It is critical that nutrients in our body are available in sufficient amounts and in the right proportions. This can be achieved by eating a balanced diet. We must eat a variety of foods, since different foods contain different nutrients in varying amounts. In stressing the importance of variety in our diet, Nutrition Australia encourages all Australians to ensure that their daily diet includes 30 individual foods. This may appear impossible at first thought, but in reality can easily be attained by eating typical diets based on carefully selected foods.

As in today’s nutrition calculator web application are just calculating the calories of the food. So which is not enough to know that they can eat the food or not. In order to overcome that we are developing the web application which get some data about the user’s current body weight, height and age and we calculate their BMI and suggest that they can eat this food or not and also if they definitely wants to eat the food we can list the suggestion (like do exercise for half an hour and take a walk to 10 minutes etc..,) to burn the calories which is added because of the intake of the food. So this web application which automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food and suggests some workout measures to lose the added calories into their body by using Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for accurate food identification and Food API's to give the nutritional value of the identified food.

Motivation
The main motivation behind the web application is that to create a simple nutrition and calories detector for the user by just sending the images of the food. Because in today’s people busy lifestyle, they ignore the healthy food habits and attract towards the fast foods even though they are aware of the effects of the fast food for their health. So, Obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is reflective of the risks to people’s health. People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods, which is the most basic method to avoid obesity.

However, although food packaging comes with nutrition (and calorie) labels, it’s still not very convenient for people to refer to App based nutrient dashboard systems which can analyse real-time images of a meal and analyse it for nutritional content which can be very handy and improves the dietary habits, and therefore, helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

So, we are developing this project which aims at building a web Application that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food. Our method employs Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for accurate food identification and Food APIs to give the nutritional value of the identified food

# Project Workflow

Signing in and providing user’s personal details.

Generating an automated email to confirm user’s registration.

Logging in to the application.

User interacts with the web application to load an image.

The image is passed to the server application, which uses Clarifai’s AI-Driven Food Detection Model Service.

Analyzing the images and Nutrition API to provide nutritional information about the analyzed Image.

Integration of Sendgrid Service with Python

Nutritional information of the analyzed image is returned to the application for display

#Objective

Wellness and healthy lifestyles have become mainstream. Interest in fitness applications and revenue from them grow as fast as the number of people striving to be fit. Due to the ignorance of healthy food habits, obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is reflective of the risks to people’s health. People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods, which is the most basic method to avoid obesity.

However, although food packaging comes with nutrition (and calorie) labels, it’s still not very convenient for people to refer to App-based nutrient dashboard systems which can analyze real-time images of a meal and analyse it for nutritional content which can be very handy and improves the dietary habits, and therefore, helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

This project aims at building a web App that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food. Our method employs Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for accurate food identification and Food API's to give the nutritional value of the identified food.

Good health can be achieved by maintaining good behaviours such as a good night sleep, enough exercise and good nutrition. However, the competitive environment nowadays prevents such good behaviours. Thus, this work aims to develop an application on mobile devices that is able to (1) upload image of food (2) analyses the collected information in order to provide calorie present in that and (3) present the analysed results in a simple and easy to understand format.
